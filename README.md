Assignment: Classwork with CSS3 <br>
Description: I am hired by a medical center to develop a website for COVID-19 management. In this classwork, we start building some of the components of this website. Given the COVID-19 risks for patients, I've been assigned the task of designing a simple web aplication that allows users to enter their data and other questions regarding potential symptoms. The web app can then use this self-proclaimed information to determine whether the patient needs to get tested, treated, or hospitalized. In this part, I added some bootstrap form styling, as well as an external css stylesheet file to experiment with the look of the form. <br>
